Numerical analyses of Biological Data. 
A unified mathematical/time series framework for modeling and mining biological data. 
Applications range from cardio-respiratory, renal blood pressure/flow and sequence 
(DNA,RNA, proteins) to gene expression data. Tools of data analysis include linear algebra, 
interpolation and extrapolation, parametric and nonparametric spectral estimation with the 
FFT and singular value decomposition, statistical description of data and integration of 
ordinary differential equations. Special focus will be placed on the use of linear and nonlinear 
numerical methods for the identification of physiological system dynamics and the development 
of computer simulation techniques to study dynamic response of physiological systems
