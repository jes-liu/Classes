This course introduces the use of mathematics and computer simulation to study 
a wide range of problems in biology. Topics include the modeling of populations, 
the dynamics of signal transduction and gene-regulatory networks, and simulation 
of protein structure and dynamics. A computer laboratory component allows students 
to apply their knowledge to real-world problems.
