In this course, we will study how electrical signals are generated and propagated in biological tissue. 
From the basics of Ohm's Law, as well as the laws that govern diffusion and electric field theory, 
we will develop mathematical models of bioelectric processes as well as perform simulations of these 
processes using Matlab. Understanding these signals at the cell and membrane level will provide a 
foundation for understanding proper nerve, cardiac and muscle function, as well as disease conditions. 
Using this understanding, we will examine state-of-the-art applications in current literature.
