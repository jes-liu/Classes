An introduction to the realm of molecular bioengineering with a focus on genetic engineering. 
Includes the structure and function of DNA, the flow of genetic information in a cell, genetic mechanisms, 
the methodology involved in recombinant DNA technology and its application in society in terms of cloning 
and genetic modification of plants and animals (transgenics), biotechnology (pharmaceutics, genomics), 
bioprocessing (production and process engineering focusing on the production of genetically engineered products.), 
and gene therapy. Production factors such as time, rate, cost, efficiency, safety, and desired product quality are 
also covered. Considers societal issues involving ethical and moral considerations, consequences of regulation, as 
well as risks and benefits of genetic engineering
